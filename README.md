# Filter and sort a dynamically created table with Vanilla JavaScript

This mini Vanilla JS project is about dynamically creating a table, which is filterable and sortable. We managed to perform these operations by resorting to several amazing JavaScript higher-order functions.

From time to time, I enjoy dealing with this kind of projects because these kinds of functions are always handy when we are dealing with a larger project (as they are being part of it). Besides, once we shift our focus to mini-projects, we generally practice & improve our skills, discover extended use cases and produce our code in various forms.
